Gray Flag is an exploration game about exploring colors in Grey Islands!<br>
Explore the colorless islands and find the Runes of Color to give them back their liveliness!<br>
Use WASD to move around, E to interact with the sail, Left Click to attack, Right Click to use your hook! (You can only hook designated spots)<br>
Explore 4 different islands with 4 different colors hidden in them! (Be prepared for hook action) Don't miss the details of the islands, each have their own spots of interest!<br>
Find all colors to "beat" the game. (There are some small bugs and the hook is kinda hard to use but it's playable!)
Starting the game takes time, don't worry it will load eventually :)
